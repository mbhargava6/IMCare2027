# Content review — 2026 rebuild

Every page, bio, service and resource link from the previous site was carried
over. This file lists the places where wording is **new** or was **corrected**,
so it can be checked by a clinician before the site goes live on imcare.ca.

## New wording added (please confirm or delete)

| Where | Text | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home hero | "Specialist care, close to home at IMCare" | `_layouts/home.html` |
| Home hero card | "New here? Ask your family doctor to fax a referral to (855) 755-7771, or download our referral form." | `_layouts/home.html` |
| Services | Plain-language `note:` lines under echocardiography, Holter monitoring, stress testing, ABPM and cryotherapy | `_data/services.yml` |
| Services | Group summaries used on the home page cards | `_data/services.yml` |
| Team | The three group headings and their one-line descriptions | `_data/team_groups.yml` |
| Contact | Emergency callout: "If you are having chest pain, difficulty breathing, signs of a stroke…" | `contact.md` |
| Contact | "For referring providers" section | `contact.md` |
| Directions | "When you arrive" — bring health card, medication list, test results | `directions.md` |
| Services | "Echocardiograms are performed in our own echocardiography lab at the Port Hope office by registered cardiac sonographers." | `_data/services.yml` |
| Privacy | "Your personal health information is confidential… ask to speak with our privacy contact." | `privacy-policy.md` |
| Footer | "This website does not provide medical advice. In an emergency, call 911." | `_includes/footer.html` |
| 404 page | Whole page (the old site had none) | `404.html` |

Nothing above states a clinical fact, a wait time, a credential or an hours of
operation that was not already on the old site.

## Corrections made

- **"Defribrillator" → "Defibrillator"** (Patient Tools, two entries).
- **Two identical ICD links merged** into one entry, "Implantable Cardioverter
  Defibrillator (ICD)".
- **"ABC of Melanoma" → "ABCDEs of Melanoma"** to match the page it links to.
- **Broken link fixed:** *Exercise for Bone Health* had a stray apostrophe in
  the URL (`osteoporosis.ca/exercise'`) and did not work.
- **Broken link fixed:** *Portfolio diet* was missing its leading slash, so it
  broke on every page except the home page.
- **Duplicate removed:** "Skin cancer screening" appeared twice in the
  dermatology service list.
- **"Mcgill" → "McGill"** in Dr. Boivin's biography.
- **"Specialist Referrals"** ended with a stray ". ." — removed.
- **Removed a spam link.** The previous Directions page carried a hidden
  "Internet Provider" link to `kbj9qpmy.com`, injected by the third-party map
  embed generator that was used. The map is now a plain Google Maps embed with
  no third-party code and no API key.

## Confirmed by Dr. Bhargava, 5 September 2026

- **Pulmonary Medicine removed.** The service group, its two items and every
  mention in the page descriptions and search metadata are gone. IMCare does
  not offer this service.
- **Clinic hours published:** Monday to Friday, 9:00 am – 5:00 pm, by
  appointment only. They now appear on the home page action strip, the
  Directions page, the Contact page, the footer of every page, and in the
  site's structured data (so Google can show them in search results).
- **No Chest Pain Clinic.** Nothing was added, and nothing referring to one
  exists on the site.
- **Echocardiography lab named.** IMCare's own echo lab is now stated on the
  Services page and in the site description.

## Still worth deciding before launch

1. **The privacy page** on the old site actually contained the practice's
   founding history, not a privacy policy. That text now lives on
   `/about/`, and `/privacy-policy/` links to the privacy PDF.
2. **`/about/` used to be the team page.** It is now a genuine About page that
   links to `/team/`. Any external links to `imcare.ca/about/` will still work
   but will land somewhere different.
3. **13 team members are hidden** (`hidden: true` in `_data/team.yml`) because
   their profiles were switched off on the old site. Worth checking whether any
   should be restored: Darius Seidler, Khalid Pasha, Natasha Thompson, Kaitlin
   Dizon, Sohayla Arabi, Kathleen Bowles, Sarah Saunders, Shannon Murphy, Darla
   Murphy, Kathy Boon, Loretta Tamburello. Obed Adarkwah and Simran Jeet were
   hidden on 8 September 2026 at Dr. Bhargava's request.
4. **External links were not machine-checked.** 60 of the 77 Patient Tools
   links point to other organisations' websites (Ottawa Heart, AAD, Cleveland
   Clinic, Vimeo, YouTube). They should be clicked through once before launch.

## Patient Tools rebuilt in plain language — 8 September 2026

Dr. Bhargava asked for the page to be organised by what a patient actually
came looking for, in words a patient would use.

**All 77 links are still there.** This was verified link-by-link against the
previous version: none lost, none added. What changed is how they are grouped
and what each one is called.

### New topics

| Topic | What it covers | Items |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staying Well | Food, activity, quitting smoking, knowing when to ask for help | 11 |
| Heart Disease | Chest pain, heart attacks, heart failure, rhythm problems, procedures | 28 |
| Stroke | Warning signs and what to do | 2 |
| Blood Pressure, Diabetes & Cholesterol | The everyday numbers that protect the heart and vessels | 7 |
| Skin & Hair | Rashes, moles, skin cancer, acne, hair loss | 21 |
| Bone Health | Keeping bones strong (osteoporosis) | 2 |
| Getting Ready for Your Test | What to expect and how to prepare | 6 |

The previous groupings — "Decision Making", "Heart & Brain", "Skin", "Bone
Health", "Preparing for Your Test" — are gone. Stroke was pulled out of
"Heart & Brain" into its own topic, and blood pressure, diabetes and
cholesterol were pulled out of the heart handouts into their own topic.

**"Cardiometabolic disease" is titled "Blood Pressure, Diabetes &
Cholesterol"** on the page. The medical term is accurate but is not what a
patient would search for. Say the word if you would rather it carried the
clinical name.

### Two topics are thin

**Stroke has only 2 resources** (the warning-signs handout and one video) and
**Bone Health has 2** (exercise and recipes from Osteoporosis Canada). Both
now have their own card on the page, which sets an expectation the content
does not yet meet. Worth adding a few resources to each, or folding them back
into a neighbouring topic.

### Navigation

- A **topic chooser** at the top: seven cards, each with a plain description
  and a count, jumping to that section.
- The **search box** now hides the chooser while you are searching and reports
  an honest count. Searching matches the resource name and its topic only.
- Within each topic, resources are grouped as **Read about it** / **Watch a
  short video** / **Handouts to print** instead of "Web Resources / Video
  Education / Handouts".
- A **Back to all topics** link closes every section.

### Every reworded link, for checking

77 of the 77 labels were rewritten in plainer language. The
destination of each is unchanged.

## Beyond the Heartline — added 8 September 2026

Dr. Bhargava's Substack, linked from four places, all driven by one block in
`_data/site.yml`. Delete that block and every link disappears at once.

| Where | How it appears |
| --- | --- |
| Patient Tools | A highlighted panel above the topic chooser — the most visible spot on the page |
| Patient Tools → Staying Well | First item under "Read about it" |
| About IMCare | Its own section, headed "Beyond the Heartline" |
| Footer, every page | "Beyond the Heartline" in the Site list |

The wording on the site is the publication's own name and its own description,
taken from the newsletter's RSS feed rather than written for it:

> **Beyond the Heartline** — Dr. Bhargava's newsletter
> A newsletter exploring the intersection of medicine, technology, and human
> experience, written by a physician passionate about AI, creativity, and
> compassionate care.

Both lines are in `_data/site.yml` under `substack:`; editing them there
updates all four places together.

The link is the publication address, `beyondtheheartline.substack.com` — more
durable than a Substack profile URL, which changes if the handle changes.

**Not done, worth considering:** the page does not list recent posts. Titles
would go stale the moment a new one is published, and a static site cannot
read the feed at page load without JavaScript that Substack's CORS policy may
block. If recent posts on the site are wanted, the reliable route is to add
the three or four current titles to `_data/site.yml` by hand and refresh them
when a new post goes out.

## Live-site check — 8 September 2026

The site went live at `mbhargava6.github.io/IMCare2027/` and was checked in a
real browser rather than only against the local build.

**Passed:** all 9 pages return 200; all 59 internal URLs resolve (pages, the
29 PDFs, images, CSS, JS) with nothing broken; no broken images; the crimson
palette, 17px base type and warm background all render as intended.

**One bug found and fixed.** The `@font-face` rule pointed at
`/assets/fonts/playfair-display.woff2` — a path from the site root. Once
`baseurl: "/IMCare2027"` was added, that address 404'd and every heading fell
back to Georgia. Nothing visibly failed: the page just quietly rendered in the
wrong typeface. The rule now uses `../fonts/…`, relative to the stylesheet, so
it resolves both under the project URL and later at imcare.ca.

Worth remembering: **`relative_url` only applies inside Liquid templates.**
Paths written inside a plain `.css` file get no baseurl, so any future
`url(...)` in the stylesheet should be written relative to the stylesheet.
